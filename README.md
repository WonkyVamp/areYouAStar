# Are you a Star?

## Overview
This project involves the classification of celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and quasars, based on their unique spectral characteristics. Utilizing an array of machine learning models, the project aims to achieve optimal accuracy and efficiency in the categorization of these celestial entities.

## Key Achievements
- **Machine Learning Models Development**: A comprehensive exploration and fine-tuning of several machine learning models, namely:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Extra Tree
  - XGBoost
  - AdaBoost
 
- **Ensemble-driven Accuracy**: Employed the Random Forest and Extra Tree models collaboratively to harness the power of ensemble learning, which significantly boosted the model's accuracy and minimized overfitting concerns.

- **Computational Efficiency with XGBoost**: Optimized the XGBoost model to ensure a harmonious balance between computational speed and classification precision.

- **Iterative Learning with AdaBoost**: Incorporated the AdaBoost model to enhance the classification procedure, particularly targeting and learning from previously misclassified instances.

## Future Directions
While the current models have shown promising results, continuous research and improvement efforts are underway. We aim to further optimize model performance, delve deeper into advanced classification techniques, and expand the range of celestial objects classified.
